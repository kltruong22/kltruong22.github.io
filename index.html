            <h1> About Me </h1>
            <p>

                I have been passionate about technology since I was a kid. When I got my first smart phone from my
                brother-in-law, I spent days to learn how to jailbreak the phone and install some extensions that were
                not
                supported by Apple. Not only iPhone, but I also learned how to root an Android device when I got an
                Android
                phone from my cousin. I knew then that I wanted to pursue software development as my career. <br>

                <br>
                I got my first Associate Degree from Houston Community College, which I focused on programming. Due to
                my
                personal finance, I took a year off from college and worked for a local restaurant which I obtained
                assistant manager role and learned leadership and management skills. I continue to pursue my dream
                career at
                <a href="https://vt.edu/" id="vt"> Virginia Tech</a>, and I am currently a rising senior in Computer
                Science minor
                in Cybersecurity and actively seeking an internship in software/web development.
